# Access the Custom Learning Administration page

The Custom Learning Administration page is the central controlling point for administration of the Microsoft 365 learning pathways web part. The learning pathways Administration page is only available to SharePoint Administrators. Users with member privileges visiting the site will not see the **Administer Playlist** option. In addition, only Administrators will have the ability to open the Custom Learning Administration page from the SharePoint **Home** menu item.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes made on the Custom Learning Administration page, such as hiding a product subcategory or playlist, will be reflected in all instances of the Web part. In addition, itâ€™s recommended that only one administrator at time make changes on the Custom Learning Administrator page, since Custom Learning does not provide collision detection if multiple people are using the Custom Learning Administration at the same time.  

## Access from the Custom Learning Web part - preferred method
As we'll show you in this example, opening the Custom Learning Administration page from the web part is the preferred method since it opens the Admin page in a new browser window. With this method, it's easy to flip back and forth between the tabbed pages to check or modify your work.  

1. From the Microsoft 365 learning pathways Home page, click the **Office 365 training** tile.
2. Click the **System** menu, then click **Administer Playlist**.

## Access from the Home menu item
Rather than navigate to a page with a Web part, administrators can access the Microsoft learning adminstration page from the SharePoint **Home** menu item. 

- From the Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways Home page, click the **Home** menu, then click **Microsoft learning administration**.
